\title{Run a power analysis on counts and design matrix}
\usage{
runPower(
  countsMatrix,
  designMatrix,
  depth = c(10, 100, 1000),
  N = c(3, 6, 10, 20),
  FDR = c(0.05, 0.1),
  effectSize = c(1.2, 1.5, 2),
  return = "both"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{countsMatrix}{A counts matrix. (Required)}

\item{designMatrix}{A design matrix. (Required)}

\item{depth}{A set of depth to use in the calculations.  The default depths of
c(10, 100, 1000) respectively represent a detection limit, below average
expression, and median expression levels, expressed in readcount units.}

\item{N}{A set of N value to report power for. (Default = c(3, 6, 10, 20))}

\item{FDR}{FDR thresholds to filter for for FDR vs. Power graph. (Default = c(0.05, 0.1))}

\item{effectSize}{A set of fold change values to test. (Default = c(1.2, 1.5, 2))}

\item{return}{One of "dataframe", "plots", "both". (Default = "both").
Two plots are generated; a ROC curve (FDR vs. Power) and a plot of N vs. Power.}
}
\value{
A list of result objects as defined by the "return" argument.
}
\description{
Take a counts matrix and design matrix and return a power analysis using
the RNASeqPower package. The counts matrix should be pre-filtered to remove
non-expressed genes using an appropriate filtering criteria. The design matrix
should describe the major sources of variation so the procedure can dial
out those known effects for the power calculations.
}
\details{
If return = "dataframe," the function will return a tall skinny dataframe
of power calculations for various requested combinations of N and significance
thresholds.  If return = "plots" or "both", a list is returned with two
ggplots (plots) or the plots plus the dataframe (both).
