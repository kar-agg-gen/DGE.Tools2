Description: Provides a function toolkit to facilitate reproducible RNA-Seq DGE
    analysis by standardizing several types of common
    plots. The functions can be grouped into three categories: DGE workflow, DGE
    plotting tools, and mapping/unit conversion functions. The DGE workflow functions
    include: Function runEdgeRNorm which normalizes counts; Function runVoom runs
    limma voom and lmfit adding additional data to the DGEobj; Function runSVA for
    detrending unknown covariates. A variety of QC plots are produced to evaluate
    data quality. The DGE Plotting tools are suitable for downstream analysis
    visualizations and include: profilePlot, volcanoPlot, comparePlot, plotPvalHist,
    ggplotMDS, and others. Function convertCounts is supplied to convert a counts
    matrix and produce CPM/TPM/FPKM, logged or not, normalized or not.
